Project Name: (temporary) Voice Broadcast for Whop
Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Server Actions, Whop API, Fish Audio API

ROLE & OBJECTIVE

You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect.

Your task is to build a Whop App that allows creators/admins to:

Post text updates normally inside the app

Display the full original post to members

Optionally generate an AI-summarized voice version using the creator’s cloned voice

Send that voice summary via Whop DM to only the eligible members (company or product scoped)

This app does NOT replace posts.
It adds an optional audio broadcast layer controlled by the creator.

CORE PRODUCT PRINCIPLES

Creator control first
Nothing is auto-sent. Every broadcast is opt-in.

Members never lose original context
The full post is always visible inside the app.

Zero spam tolerance
Cooldowns, previews, and opt-outs are mandatory.

Voice authenticity & consent
Voice cloning requires explicit creator consent.
